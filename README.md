Please read the paper first to understand our research as the context for these materials.

## Device Interaction
In the **Device Interaction** folder, there are two sub-folders, namely **Manual Study** and **Automation** that contain the results for the **Device Interaction** category from the manual study and automated conflict detection using IoTCheck respectively.
In the **Device Interaction/Manual Study** folder, the manual study results are reported per device group (see **Table 1** in the paper). These results are compiled in the file **Summary Statistics - Device - Manual Study**. The statistics are reported in **Table 3** in the paper.
In the **Device Interaction/Automation** folder, the automated conflict detection results are reported also per device group. These results are compiled in the file **Summary Statistics - Device - Automation**. The statistics are reported in **Table 6** in the paper.

## Physical-Medium Interaction
In the **Physical-Medium Interaction** folder, there is a file named **Physical-Medium - Manual Study** that contains the results for the **Physical-Medium Interaction** from the manual study. IoTCheck only gives a warning when it detects that the interaction between apps in a pair may result in a **Physical-Medium Conflict**, but it does not report it as a real conflict (please see **Section 5 - Physical Factors** in the paper).

## Global-Variable Interaction
In the **Global-Variable Interaction** folder, there are two files, namely **Global-Variable - Manual Study** and **Global-Variable - Automation** that contain the results for the **Global-Variable Interaction** category from the manual study and automated conflict detection using IoTCheck respectively.
The results summary in the file **Global-Variable - Manual Study** is reported in **Table 4** in the paper.
The results summary in the file **Global-Variable - Automation** is reported in **Table 6** in the paper.
